Atelier 20th Anniversary Title

An Atelier town built together with legendary 
alchemists.

This title aims to combine the “slice-of-life” 
atmosphere of living in a town and collaborating with 
various characters and the exaltation that comes from 
successfully governing a town and expanding your world.

This title is designed to represent a new milestone in 
the evolution of the “Atelier” series, marking their 
20th anniversary, and its theme is: Town-management 
Simulation x RPG.

We aim to provide our fans with an entirely new 
"Atelier" experience, while also inviting back many 
popular characters of past titles.
